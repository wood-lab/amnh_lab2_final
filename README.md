#Example Analysis for the AMNH Parasite Ecology Module Lab 2
# Now in RStudio

This analysis will load the dataset, make sure all the variables are correctly categorized by R. Then the code will generate tables of the means and standard errors of parasite abundance within each of the hosts in fished and unfished areas. Finally, it generates a plot of the means and standard errors of abundance using ggplot2. 

1. Install `holepunch` with `remotes::install_github("karthik/holepunch")`
2. Then run the following code:

```r
library(holepunch)
write_compendium_description(package = "Your compendium name", 
                             description = "Your compendium description")
# to write a description, with dependencies listed 
# It's good practice to now go fill in the placeholder text.

write_dockerfile(maintainer = "your_name") 
# To write a dockerfile. It will automatically pick the date of the last modified file, match it to 
# that version of R and add it here. You can override this by passing r_date to some arbitrary date
# (but one for which a R version exists).

generate_badge()
# This generates a badge for your readme.

# At this time ðŸ™Œ push the code to GitHub ðŸ™Œ
# If you're new to Git/GitHub, you can click the Git tab on Rstudio, then click commit to see
# all changed files/folders, including the hidden .binder folder. Give this a commmit message and push

# And click on the badge or use the function below to get the binder built ahead of time.
build_binder()
# ðŸ¤žðŸš€

Now, run through analysis.R till you get to a plot
```

Does clicking the badge launch binder for you? If not, please [file an issue](https://github.com/karthik/binder-test/issues/new).
